**Prompt:** *Every socialist society will have a class of jobs that people just plain won't love to do (with a few exceptions, since humans aren't a monolith). Some big examples include trash collection, janitorial work, and any job in which you're in some amount of physical danger. How would you allocate such jobs to make sure people fill them?*

**Answer:**

In order to determine how to allocate the less desirable jobs in society, we must first figure out how the majority of jobs are allocated. This sketch is merely a social "mock-up"; there are few or no considerations made for path-dependency of systems (i.e., things that would be "sticky" in society because there's such a strong tradition around them) for the purposes of this essay.

On its most basic level, employment in a society can be defined using a series of spreadsheets: occupation, name, duration of occupation, salary, location, etc. This would give a rough "map" of society at any given time, and would make it much easier to see where more or fewer people are needed in a particular sector. Such spreadsheets would start locally - how many people are employed as teachers, health workers, construction workers, professors, etc.,  in a given area - which would then give state and/or federal governments an idea for the needs of the community. Additionally, shortages of employment in a given sector will be noted, as well as population change. (Why? For example, if there is a large boom of young families, you will be needing more elementary education professionals than you had before.)

If there is a shortage of workers for a given type of job in a community, the state or federal government would first put out a call for individuals in nearby communities to fill the positions. If there is still a shortage, perks will be added to the position (e.g., higher pay than the average, more favorable hours) until all positions are full. *Note: all individuals serving in this position will receive these perks, not just the marginal sign-ons.* If that still doesn't work, the search is expanded nationwide, with the perks still intact. We expect that a regional search will suffice for most positions, particularly if training is offered on the job. 

The only jobs it is foreseeably difficult to fill due to actual lack of supply (vs. lack of exploring individuals farther from the location) would be jobs which require a high degree of education, because it is not possible to train these individuals on the job, since training takes up to a decade. These professionals include doctors, lawyers, and research scientists. However, if we make it as easy as possible (with the same educational rigor) to *become* one of these professionals, we can prevent a shortage before it ever happens.

There is one other type of job which will foreseeably have a worker shortage, though: the just plain undesirable jobs; the ones no one (on average) really *wants* to do, especially in a socialist society where so many jobs would offer self-fulfillment. (Though, importantly, under socialism, jobs would not be the *sole* source of self-fulfillment to individuals, as they're encouraged to be now). A classic example of these jobs is a garbage collector: it's smelly, sometimes gross, manually taxing labor. Jobs like this will be relatively easy to identify after a few years of socialism - they will be the jobs that every year (or quarter, etc.) are low on applicants, and in particular jobs who don't receive enough applications to fill all the positions. 

With these patterns identified, society has two (non-contradictory!) options:

1. Ask workers in these jobs what it is they find so odious about them, and fix as many of these issues as possible. Additionally, automate as many "shitty jobs" as possible, leaving workers who would have had to perform them free to pursue other things. (Remember: automation is not the soul-killer it is in the capitalist context. The more automation, the more free time available to *enhance* a society. It's amazing what the lack of profit motive does.)
2. Preemptively give perks to holding one of these jobs. For example, at the end of a three year term as a garbage collector, you receive a stipend of a living wage for the next three years, during which time you are free to do whatever you want. These perks can be permanent, so people applying for these jobs know the perks they'll be receiving. This can, hopefully, eliminate the predicted shortage of workers willing to work these "shitty jobs".

One thing I do want to note is that everyone in this socialist society earns approximately the same amount of money, as well as a housing voucher. Everyone performs a job if they are able, and those unable receive the same wages as those without a disability. This is why it would be such a big perk to make extra money as a shitty job holder; similarly so with the guaranteed years of free time.

On the opposite side, I have not worked out the issues with too many people wanting to be employed in a particularly desirable position. These are likely to be non-essential: artist, music teacher, musician, performing arts, and many that don't even exist right now in our capitalist economy. (For example, my dream socialist job is to make prosthetics really beautiful pieces of art that their wearers feel good about themselves in.) Option one is that all essential workers are filled and so people can all choose non-essential jobs, or option two, qualification standards for a given position will be made harsher. (E.g., only so many people can be professional artists; a body of work would be a qualification standard.)

In sum, we fill "shitty jobs" by offering incentives to work them, and simultaneously work towards automating such positions so no one has to do them. In my model this is tracked by a series of spreadsheets of how many essential workers are needed in each economic zone (town, county, etc.), including the "shitty jobs". In this way, we track the shitty jobs along with the average ones, preemptively adding perks to jobs that no one really wants to sign up for. Once filled, we provide on the job training, so anyone can apply if they so choose.
