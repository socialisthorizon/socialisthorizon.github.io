**Prompt:** *Every socialist society will have a class of jobs that people just plain won't love to do (with a few exceptions, since humans aren't a monolith). Some big examples include trash collection, janitorial work, and any job in which you're in some amount of physical danger. How would you allocate such jobs to make sure people fill them?*

In every society there are jobs that the majority of the population would never deign to because they were too dangerous, too tedious, unsanitary, or underpaid. Unless widespread automation of work can be achieved, an American socialist society will deal with this same issue. For the purpose of this essay I will only be speaking about trash collection specifically and undesirable jobs generally. The reason for this is right now, we can eliminate the least desirable parts of trash collection due to consolidation of trash collection firms into utilities and less trash generated in a socialist society, fewer people would actually need to perform the work of collecting or processing garbage. 

## Centralization of Industry

Capitalism, despite what we’re told, is horrifically inefficient when it comes to providing services an entire community needs. In every place I’ve lived trash has never been collected by a department of the local government like it is in some cities. This means there are multiple firms all competing over the same areas with their own trash collectors, landfill workers, and what not. Forcing these firms to consolidate into a single public utility would allow the redundant jobs to be eliminated, meaning fewer people would need to perform the same task. Free from the capitalist competition and the need to generate profit, the remaining workers could be, and in a truly socialist society would be, paid a wage befitting the service they do. Additionally with all firms consolidated into a single utility, more efficient practices and tools could be applied meaning the quality of work should be easier on the remaining employees. 

## Trash under Socialism

Once the economy is put towards the good of society and not solely generating profit so much of the garbage that defines our current life will disappear. Meaningless plastic products with no real use value, overly elaborate packaging, or imperfect ‘ugly’ produce left to rot because it doesn't look marketable; these will all disappear under a socialist economic system as they are created by the need to profit. Less garbage will mean fewer people need to collect it. 

## Conclusion

This is only one way in which a future American socialist society can answer the issue of undesirable jobs by merely changing the structure of our society. Removing the inefficiency of capitalism will lead to fewer undesirable jobs and grant those who choose to do those jobs a higher standard of life.
